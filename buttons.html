  <p>style --> some name is a CSS selector. 
    Which element we are targeting.
    Attribute "class" - allows us to label HTML elements. Means that
    we set a label to a particular element.
    TO TARGET a class in CSS we have to start our style from DOT (.)
    ex. ".subscribe-button". Without a DOT we target an element name NOT
    a class name. Different elements may have the same class name.
  </p>
  <p>
    In CSS space (around an element) = MARGIN
    .subscribe-button:hover <-- styles from over there will be added to regular styles.
    .subscribe-button:active <-- when clicked.
    opacity: 0-1;
  </p>
  <p>
    transition property takes TWO values. 1-what to transition, 2-how long
    as an example "transition: opacity 1s;" to add several elements to transition just use a COMMA (,)
    ALWAYS put "transition" to base-button CSS style not to HOVER or active.
  </p>
  <p>
    box-shadow property takes 4 values(no commas between them). 
    1-toRight, 2-doDown, 3-transparency, 4-color(rgba).
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS Box MODEL to add spaces.

    We moved our css code to a new file. Thus we have to use <strong>Link</strong>
    element. This element DOES NOT have closing tag. AKA void element.
    Takes 2 attributes 1-rel="  ", 2-href="  ". href, in this case, looks css file in THE SAME FOLDER
    as our main code resides. If we move CSS to a new folder (our from local visibility) we have to specify the path manually
    rel="" and href="" may be used to add fonts to our page. Be default there are few fonts available. 
    We may search for a font and add link to it. (Google fonts)
